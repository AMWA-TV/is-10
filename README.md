# \[Work In Progress\] AMWA IS-10 NMOS Authorization Specification

AMWA IS-10 specifies an API for the authorization of other NMOS APIs. 

This repository provides the "source" for this Specification.

For an HTML rendering of this Specification see <https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos-authorization>

Readers are advised to be familiar with:

- The [overview of Networked Media Open Specifications](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos)
- [AMWA BCP-003](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos-api-security) Best Practices for NMOS API Security

Readers should then read the [documentation](docs/) in this repository, and the [APIs](APIs/), which are written in RAML -- if a suitable tool is not available for reading this, then [this](APIs/generateHTML) will create HTML versions.

> HTML rendered versions of all NMOS Specifications are available on the [NMOS GitHub pages](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos)
