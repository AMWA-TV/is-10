# Behaviour: Tokens

_(c) AMWA 2019, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

## Access Tokens

The access token type returned MUST be of the `Bearer_token` type specified in [RFC 6750][RFC-6750].

The access token MUST be a JSON Web Signature (JWS) as defined by [RFC 7515][RFC-7515]. JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) MUST
NOT be used.

The JWS MUST be signed with `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512`, meaning the value of the `alg` field in the token's JOSE
(JSON Object Signing and Encryption) header (see [RFC 7515][RFC-7515]) MUST be set to `RS512` as defined in
[RFC 7518][RFC-7518]. An example JOSE header would be:

```json
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "RS512"
}
```

### Registered Claims

Registered claims are defined in the authorization JSON Web Token specification in [RFC 7519][RFC-7519], but their
specific usage is left to the application. NMOS API Clients and Servers implementing this specification MUST employ the
restrictions on claims outlined below, in addition to implementing tokens as specified in [RFC 7519][RFC-7519].

#### iss
_Identifies principal that issued the JWT_

The `iss` (issuer) claim MUST be included in the token. The claim MUST contain the DNS name and port of the
Authorization Server accessible to the audience of the token. The contents of this claim MUST match one entry in the
common name field or alternate names fields in all TLS certificates used by the Authorization Server for securing the
authorization API, in order to allow the verifier of the token to fetch the public key of the Authorization Server.

#### sub
_Identifies the subject of the JWT_

The `sub` (subject) claim MUST be included in the token. This claim MUST contain a unique identifier assigned to the
end-user by the user authorization system. For example, this may be a username in a Single Sign-On (SSO) system, or the
email address of the user.

For the authorization code grant, the subject typically identifies the authorized accessor for which the access token
is being requested.

#### aud
_Identifies the recipients of the JWT_

The `aud` (audience) claim MUST be included in the token. AMWA NMOS APIs are free to specify their own audience
claims, but in the absence of specification resource servers SHOULD assume that the audience claim contains the fully
resolved domain name of the intended recipient, or a domain name containing wild-card characters in order to target a
subset of devices on a network. Such wild-carding of domain names is documented in [RFC 4592][RFC-4592].

If the `aud` claim is present and does not match the fully resolved domain name of the resource server, the Resource
Server MUST reject the token.

#### exp
_Expiration time of the token_

The `exp` (expiration) claim MUST be included in the token. This is defined in [RFC 7519][RFC-7519] as being a JSON
NumericDate field, which uses the UTC epoch. This is in contrast to the TAI epoch used elsewhere within the NMOS APIs,
so implementers should take care to ensure they are using the correct epoch.

API implementations MUST reject a token where the `exp` claim value is less than the current UTC time. Refer to the
[Token Lifetime](#token-lifetime) Section for guidance on setting this value.

#### iat
_Token issued at time_

The `iat` (issued at) claim MAY be included in the token. As with the `exp` claim this claim uses UTC. API
implementations MUST reject a token where the `iat` claim is greater than the current UTC time. Authorization Servers
SHALL issue a token with an `iat` claim that is equal to the UTC time at which the token is issued.

#### client_id
_Client ID that requested the token_

The `client_id` claim MUST be included in the token, as per Section 2.2 of the draft RFC [Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access
Tokens]. This claim corresponds with the client identifier of the OAuth 2.0 client that requested the token. The value
of this claim MUST exactly match the full client identifier to which the token was granted.

#### scope
_List of scopes associated with the token_

The `scope` claim SHOULD be included in the token, if the authorization request included a scope parameter, as per
Section 2.2.2 of the draft RFC [Profile for OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens]. The value of the "scope" claim is a JSON string
containing a space-separated list of scopes associated with the token, in the format described in Section 3.3 of
[RFC6749][RFC-6749].

### Private Claims

[RFC 7519][RFC-7519] allows for "private claims". The following claim is used to identify the API specification a given
token is used for.

#### x-nmos-api
_Contains information particular to the NMOS API the token is intended for_

The `x-nmos-api` claim MUST be included in the token. The value of the claim is a JSON object, the contents of which
are `key:value` pairs, with the `keys` identifying an individual AMWA NMOS API using the identifier found in the DNS-SD
advertisement, and the `value` being a JSON array indicating access permissions for that API. An empty `x-nmos-api`
claim MUST indicate no access to any of the APIs. A missing API key MUST indicate no access to that specific API.

```json
"x-nmos-api": {
  "register": {},
  "connection": {}
}
```

The `value` for each NMOS API indicates the access rights of the given user for that specific API. The value required
by the Resource Server MUST exactly match one of the values in the array. General access rights include:
*   **write** - ability to insert a new, or edit an existing, resource. This usually takes the form of POST, PUT or
    PATCH HTTP request verbs.
*   **read** - ability to retrieve the resource. This usually takes the form of GET and HEAD HTTP request verbs.

Individual AMWA specifications MAY specify additional values specific to the individual API.

An example of a `x-nmos-api` claim is shown below. This would permit querying an IS-04 Registry, and making
connections via an IS-05 connection management interface, but would not permit the user to register a resource with
an IS-04 Registry.

```json
"x-nmos-api": {
  "register": ["read"],
  "query": ["read", "write"],
  "connection": ["write", "read"]
}
```

Authorization Servers MAY only have support for certain NMOS API specifications, and MAY only support certain versions
of such APIs.

### Size Considerations

While [RFC 7519][RFC-7519] does not prescribe a maximum size for an OAuth 2.0 JSON Web Token, it should be noted that
these tokens are typically used within an HTTP header. While HTTP does not define a header size limit, 8KByte is a
common limitation in HTTP server implementations. Specification writers should be mindful of this when designing API
claims, and ensure that enough space is available in the header for both the token and all other HTTP headers.

### Example Access Token Claim Set

```json
{
  "iss": "https://auth.example.com",
  "sub": "username@example.com",
  "aud": "https://node-*.example.com",
  "iat": "1548779460",
  "exp": "1548783060",
  "scope": ["register", "query", "connection"],
  "client_id": "hopy0dNRPNTiGJDqPfqYwGmw",
  "x-nmos-api": {
    "register": ["read"],
    "query": ["read", "write"],
    "connection": ["write", "read"]
  }
}
```

### Token Lifetime

A given access token for an NMOS API may be used on more than one Node or Registry instance. If one of these Nodes or
Registries is compromised, it is possible for that entity to re-use it itself maliciously. While
the precise duration of token validity should be left to implementers and administrators based on the risk profile,
these tokens SHOULD be valid for no more than one hour.

However, if tokens are too short-lived, the number of refresh requests to the Authorization Server for new tokens
starts to become a significant overhead, and any latency involved in using a token may cause it to become invalid
during transit. As such it is RECOMMENDED that tokens be valid for at least 30 seconds.
