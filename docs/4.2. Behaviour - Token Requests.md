# Tokens Requests

## Grants

The implicit grant MUST NOT be used as it has been deprecated in Section 3.1.2. of the [OAuth 2.0 Best Common
Practice][oauth-bcp-13] guidelines.

The password grant SHOULD NOT be used as it has been deprecated in Section 3.4. of the [OAuth 2.0 Best Common
Practice][oauth-bcp-13] guidelines.

The Authorization Code Grant is recommended as the primary grant to be used with Public Clients and MUST be used
alongside PKCE as outlined in [RFC 7636][RFC-7636], in-keeping with the recommendations given in 3.1.1. of the
IETF's [OAuth 2.0 Best Common Practice][oauth-bcp-13].

It is RECOMMENDED that Section 5 of the OAuth 2.0 [Security Model][oauth-security-model] detailing Security
Considerations associated with OAuth 2.0 be followed as closely as possible to minimise chance of a security
breach, such as the leaking of Authorization codes or Refresh Tokens.

## Authorization Request and Response

Successful authorization requests for the Authorization Code Grant SHALL be provided by registered clients as 
defined in [RFC 6749][RFC-6749] Section 4.1.1.

The means by which the Authorization Server validates the end-user is not defined in this spec. Methods may include:
- Basic Authorization (or other HTTP authentication scheme)
- Login page and Session Cookies
- Integration with a larger SSO authentication system

Successful authorization response SHALL be serviced by the Authorization Server as defined in
[RFC 6749][RFC-6749] Section 4.1.2. The use of the STATE parameter SHOULD be used. Use of the PKCE `code_challenge` 
parameter SHOULD be implemented as outlined in [RFC 7636][RFC-7636].

## Access Token Request and Response

Access token requests SHALL be provided by clients as defined in [RFC 6749][RFC-6749] Section 4 based on the OAuth 
2.0 grant being used.

Successful access token responses SHALL be serviced by the Authorization Server as defined in
[RFC 6749][RFC-6749] Section 5.1. Additionally the `expires_in` and `refresh_token` fields MUST be
included in the response.

## Token Revocation

Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens SHALL be revoked by the Authorization Server as defined by [RFC 7009][RFC-7009].

OAuth 2.0 clients SHALL revoke any valid refresh tokens using the recovation endpoint upon a user ceasing to require authorization. This may be, for example, due to logging out of an application, a change of user identity or uninstalling a given application.

## Error responses

Unsuccessful token requests should follow the format described in [APIs](./2.0.%20APIs.md) and follow the
authorization [error schema](../APIs/schemas/token_error_response.json).
