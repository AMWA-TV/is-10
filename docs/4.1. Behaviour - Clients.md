# OAuth 2.0 Clients

## Discovery

Clients MUST be capable of discovering the location of an Authorization Server using DNS Service Discovery. Clients
MAY also permit manual configuration of one or more Authorization Servers.

When first contacting an Authorization Server, a Client MUST identify the location of API endpoints using the
Authorization Server Metadata resource as specified in [RFC-8414].

## Client Registration

Clients MUST be registered with the Authorization Server before initiating the OAuth 2.0 protocol as per Section 2
of [RFC-6749].

Clients SHOULD support a mechanism for providing the information required for OAuth 2.0 registration (e.g a web-page
containing the required details).

Clients and Authorization Servers are RECOMMENDED to provide for the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol
[RFC-7591] to allow dynamic registration of clients to the Authorization Server to allow for zero-configuration setup.

## Client Credentials

Clients operating with a client secret SHOULD support using HTTP Basic Authentication, as per Section 2 of [RFC-2617], to authenticate with the Authorization Server in the manner described in Section 2.3.1 of
[RFC-6749].

Client credentials should be stored by the client in a safe location in non-volatile memory in case of a device restart to prevent 
duplicate registrations.

## Requesting a Token

Refer to [Token Requests](./4.2.%20-%20Token%20Requests.md).

## Refreshing a Token

Clients SHOULD ensure tokens are refreshed sufficiently in advance of their expiry. While the exact time will depend on the 
implementation of the client and Authorization Server, it is RECOMMENDED to attempt a refresh at least 15 seconds before expiry
(i.e the half-life of the shortest-lived token possible).

## Accessing Protected Resources

When accessing protected resources clients MUST include the authorization token in the request using the Authorization
Request Header Field method described in Section 2.1 of [RFC-6750]. Clients MUST NOT use any of the other
methods specified in Section 2.0 of [RFC-6750] when making requests via HTTP/S.
