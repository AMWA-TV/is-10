# Authorization Server

## Keys

### Authorization Server Public Key

The Authorization Server MUST provide all public keys used for signing tokens at the certs endpoint of the API. The
Authorization Server MAY present more than one key on this endpoint, with each key being an entry in an array.

All public keys must be presented using the text representation used by The Secure Shell (SSH) Public Key File Format
in [RFC 4716][RFC-4716]. Each public key presented will be one entry in the array provided by the certs endpoint.

### Changing Keys

When transitioning to a new public/private key pair used for signing tokens the Authorization Server SHOULD provide
both the old and new public key at the certs endpoint until all tokens that may be verified by the old public key
would have expired. However, if a private key is known to be compromised, the Authorization Server MUST remove it
from the certs endpoint immediately.

Authorization Servers SHOULD provide new public keys on the certs endpoint for at least 2 hours before issuing tokens
signed by the corresponding private key to allow time for clients to cache the new public key.

## Client Registration

The Authorization Server MUST NOT accept unregistered clients.

Authorization Servers SHOULD support a manual mechanism for registering clients (e.g an HTML web form) allowing the
client type and redirect URIs to be provided.

Authorization Servers SHOULD provide support for client registrations providing client credentials using HTTP Basic 
Authentication, as per Section 2 of [RFC2617][RFC-2617], in the manner described in Section 2.3.1 of [RFC 6749][RFC-6749].

AMWA NMOS Specifications MAY specify additional registration parameters where they require them. Where clients and
Authorization Servers that support OAuth 2.0 are used with these specifications they SHALL use these parameters in
all OAuth 2.0 registration mechanisms they support.

Clients and Authorization Servers are RECOMMENDED to provide for the OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol
[RFC 7591][RFC-7591] to allow dynamic registration of clients to the Authorization Server to allow for zero-configuration 
setup.

### Dynamic Client Authentication

In order to prevent any node from registering as an OAuth 2.0 Client with the Authorization Server, a node SHOULD 
authenticate with the Authorization Server before being allowed to register and be administered with client credentials. The 
Authorization Server MUST NOT register an unauthenticated device.

The means by which authentication is established is beyond the scope of this specification but may include:
- A valid TLS certficate and successful HTTPS handshake
- A valid Client TLS certificate
- Operator Approval via a Web GUI
- Logging in using a Single-Sign-On (SSO) system
- An initial JSON Web Token (JWT) as suggested in Section 3 of [RFC 7591][RFC-7591]

Authorization Servers supporting dynamic client registration SHOULD provide some means of rate-limiting to prevent a DDOS 
attack on the registration endpoint.

## Client Deregistration

The Auth Server SHOULD support the deregistration of clients in the case of a compromised client. The means by which this 
client deregistering occurs is beyond the scope of this specification.
