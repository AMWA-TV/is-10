This document covers common aspects of the following API:
* [Authorization API](../APIs/AuthorizationAPI.raml)

## API Specifications

The Authorization API is specified using:
* The following sub-sections describing common API properties.
* [RAML](http://raml.org/) documents and [JSON schemas](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) in the
  [APIs](../APIs/) folder.
* Examples of JSON format output are provided in the [examples](../examples/) folder.

The Authorization Server SHALL present an instance of the NMOS [Authorization API](APIs/AuthorizationAPI.raml).

The Authorization Server MAY present multiple versions of the API on the same port, but MUST name-space them
accordingly as per the API specification.

The Authorization Server and client authentication methods MUST otherwise be implemented as per the
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC 6749][RFC-6749]. All tokens produced by the Authorization
Server MUST be Bearer Tokens using the JSON Web Token (JWT) profile as per [RFC 7523][RFC-7523].

## API Structure

The base of the api can be found at:

```
https://<ip address or hostname>:<port>/x-nmos/auth/<api version>/
```

The primary endpoints used for interaction with the Authorization Server include:

- **register-client** - used for the manual or dynamic registration of an OAuth 2.0 client with the Authorisation
  Server in line with [RFC 7591](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591).
- **authorize** - used for requesting an authorization code when using the authorization code grant.
- **token** - used for requesting a token when using any of the chosen grant types.
- **revoke** - used as the revocation endpoint for revoking currently active access tokens or refresh tokens.
- **certs** - used to expose the certificate containing the public key  that corresponds with the private key used
  to sign the access tokens.

## API Validation

JSON schemas are included with the RAML API definitions. These include validation for values used within the APIs.
These are based on the schemas defined in the [OAuth2 specification][RFC-6749]. It is RECOMMENDED that implementers
of the Authorization API use these JSON schemas as part of a validation stage when passing client registration data
to, or receiving client and token data from, the Authorization Server.

### Content Types

All API endpoints returning a JSON response MUST provide a JSON representation signalled via `Content-Type:
application/json` headers. This SHOULD be the default content type in the absence of any requested alternative by
clients. Other content types (such as HTML) are permitted if they are explicitly requested via Accept headers.

For HTTP redirections, such as when using the Authorization Code Grant, a content-type of `text/html` MAY also be returned.

### Redirections

Some of the standard grants used within the OAuth 2.0 framework make use of user-agent redirection (e.g. via a
web-browser) in order to gain user authorization. The primary grants that make use of redirection are the
Authorization Code Grant and the Implicit Grant. As such, clients performing requests using these methods MUST
correctly handle a 302 response (Found) as stated in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC 6749][RFC-6749] following the
guidelines given in [RFC 7231][RFC-7231].

The Authorization Server MUST NOT use the 307 HTTP status code for redirection as per Section 4.10. of the [OAuth
2.0 Best Common Practice][oauth-bcp-13] draft.

### API Paths

All NMOS APIs MUST use a path in the following format. Other HTTP resources MAY be presented on the same port by
the Node, provided all NMOS resources are available from the /x-nmos/ path as follows:

```
http(s)://<ip address or hostname>:<port>/x-nmos/<api type>/<api version>/
```

API clients using DNS-SD for API discovery SHOULD construct these paths by making use of the TXT records
`api\_proto` and `api\_ver`, along with addresses and ports resolved via DNS-SD.

Where protocol and versioning data is not available, clients MAY assume a `v1.0` API.

### Versioning

All public APIs are versioned as follows:

* Requesting the API base resource (such as http(s)://&lt;ip address or hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/x-nmos/auth/)   
  will provide a list containing the versions of the API present on the node.
* A versioned API response must include only resources which match the schema for that API version.
* Data which is held for mismatched minor API versions may be returned if it can be conformed to the correct schema
  (see example below). Data must never be conformed between major API versions.

**Example**

A v1.1 API response may include:
* v1.1 data without modification.
* Data conforming to schemas less than v2.0 but greater than v1.1, with any non-v1.1 keys removed.

### Common API Base Resource

```
[
  "v1.0/",
  "v2.0/"
]
```

* Appending /v1.0/ to the API base resource will request version 1.0 of the API if available.
* The versioning format is v&lt;#MAJOR&gt;.&lt;#MINOR&gt;
* MINOR increments SHOULD be performed for non-breaking changes (such as the addition of attributes in a response)
* MAJOR increments MUST be performed for breaking changes (such as the renaming of a resource or attribute)
* Versions MUST be represented as complete strings. Parsing MUST proceed as follows: separate into two strings,   
  using the point (.) as a delimiter. Compare integer representations of MAJOR, MINOR version (such that v1.12 is
  greater than v1.5).
* Clients are responsible for identifying the correct API version they require.

### URLs: Approach to Trailing Slashes

For consistency and in order to adhere to how these APIs are specified in RAML, the 'primary' path for every
resource has the trailing slash omitted.

In order to overcome shortcomings in some common libraries, the following requirements are imposed for the support
of URL paths with or without trailing slashes.

#### GET and HEAD Requests

* Clients performing requests using these methods SHOULD correctly handle a 301 response (moved permanently).
* When a 301 is supported, the client MUST follow the redirect in order to retrieve the required response payload.
* Servers implementing the APIs MUST support requests using these methods to both the trailing slash and
  non-trailing slash path to each resource. One of these MAY produce a 301 response causing a redirect to the other
  if preferred.

#### All Other Requests (PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS etc)

* Clients performing requests using these methods MUST use URLs with no trailing slash present.
* Servers implementing the APIs MUST correctly interpret requests using these methods to paths without trailing   
  slashes present.
* Servers implementing the APIs MAY correctly interpret requests using these methods to paths with trailing slashes
  present for backward compatibility.
* Servers SHOULD NOT respond with 3xx codes for these request types.

#### Client Behaviour

When a server implementation is required to indicate an API URL via an 'href' or similar attribute, it is valid to
either include a trailing slash or not provided that the listed path is accessible and abides by the policy above.
In order to avoid cases of double slashes or missing slashes, clients are required to exercise caution when
appending paths onto 'href' type attributes.

### Error Codes & Responses

The NMOS APIs use HTTP status codes to indicate success, failure and other cases to clients as per [RFC
7231][RFC-7231] and related standards. Where the RAML specification of an API specifies explicit response codes it
is expected that a client will handle these cases in a particular way. As explicit handling of every possible HTTP
response code is not expected, clients must instead implement more generic handling for ranges of response codes
(1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx and 5xx). For HTTP codes 400 and upwards, a JSON format response MUST be returned as follows:

#### Example Error Response
```
{
  "code": 400,
  "error": "OAuth Error Type",
  "error_description": "Optional Human readable message which is suitable for user interface display"
  "debug": "Programmer / debugging detail or traceback"
}
```

In the above example, the `code` SHOULD always match the HTTP status code. `error` MUST always be present and in 
string format. The format of the `error` field SHOULD follow one of the error types given by Section 5.2. of [RFC 
6749][RFC-6749]. `error_description` is an optional human-friendly message describing
the error. `debug` may be null if no further debug information is available.
