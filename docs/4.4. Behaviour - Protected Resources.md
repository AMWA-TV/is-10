# Accessing Protected Resources

_(c) AMWA 2019, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

When accessing protected resources clients MUST include the authorization token in the
request using the Authorization Request Header Field method described in Section 2.1
of [RFC 6750][RFC-6750]. Clients MUST NOT use any of the other methods specified in Section 2.0
of [RFC 6750][RFC-6750] when making requests via HTTP/S.

When a protected resources receives a token it MUST validate the claims of the token.
If a token is invalid the resource server MUST reject the request with the appropriate
HTTP error code as defined by [RFC 6750][RFC-6750].

## Operation with WebSockets

Where OAuth 2.0 is to be used with WebSockets clients SHALL provide the access token
in the HTTP GET request that initiates the Websocket handshake defined in
[RFC 6455][RFC-6455] in the same manner as a normal HTTP request as described in
[Accessing Protected Resources](#accessing-protected-resources).

The Resource Server SHALL validate such tokens in the same manner as it would for a normal
protected HTTP resources using the HTTP Authorization Request Header.

Further to this, due to limitations in the native JavaScript WebSocket API, clients MAY
pass the OAuth 2.0 access token in the query parameters of the request URL during the handshake,
using the `access_token` key, as described in [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.3).
This is only for situations in which it is not feasible to pass the token in the HTTP Authorization Header.

```

The Resource Server MUST support the parsing of access tokens in both the Authorization
HTTP Header and the query parameter. The Resource Server SHALL NOT upgrade the connection to a WebSocket if the token
is deemed invalid.
