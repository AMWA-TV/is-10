# AMWA IS-10 NMOS Authorization Specification: Overview

_(c) AMWA 2019, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

## Documentation

The documents included in this directory provide additional details and recommendations for implementations of the
defined API, and its consumers.

Familiarity with the [JT-NM reference architecture](http://jt-nm.org/) is assumed, and further definitions of OAuth 2.0
concepts as they apply to NMOS are found in both the [Definitions](./5.0.%20Definitions.md) section and the
[OAuth 2.0 standard][RFC-6749].

## Use of Normative Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC-2119].

## Introduction

This document defines the mechanism for authorization of clients and users which need to access or modify resources
held by an AMWA NMOS API. The specification requires the implementation of OAuth 2.0 as defined by various IETF RFCs,
with additions made covering the topics of discovery, preferred OAuth grant types and the use of claims within JSON Web
Tokens (JWTs).

Use of insecure communication (plain HTTP etc.) is forbidden within the scope of this document. Whilst this document
is not concerned with the security of the connection used to carry out authorization or subsequently authorised
interactions, for the authorization mechanisms described in this document to be effective the connection used MUST
be encrypted.

Implementation of [BCP-003-01][BCP-003-01] is a RECOMMENDED prerequisite to implementing this document.

## OAuth RFCs

This specification builds upon the following IETF RFCs. Compliant Authorization Servers, Resource Servers and Clients
are expected to implement the requirements set out in each of these documents:

*   [RFC 6749][RFC-6749] - The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework
*   [RFC 6750][RFC-6750] - The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage
*   [RFC 6819][RFC-6819] - OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations
*   [RFC 7009][RFC-7009] - OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation
*   [RFC 7515][RFC-7515] - JSON Web Signature (JWS)
*   [RFC 7517][RFC-7517] - JSON Web Key (JWK)
*   [RFC 7519][RFC-7519] - JSON Web Token (JWT)
*   [RFC 7523][RFC-7523] - JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants
*   [RFC 7591][RFC-7591] - OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol

*   [RFC 8628][RFC-8628] - OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant
*   [RFC 8693][RFC-8693] - OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange
*   _Draft Resource Indicators <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-indicators/>_
*   _Draft Mutual TLS <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls/>_
*   _Draft JWT Best Common Practices <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bcp/>_
*   _Draft OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practice <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics/>_
*   _Draft JWT profile for OAuth2 access tokens <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt/>_

It is intended that by using this common suite of RFCs, existing commercial or open source Authorization Servers can
be used alongside NMOS APIs with minimal modifications.

## Authorization Flow (Informative)

A simplified illustration of the authorization flow is shown below. The API client, in this case a broadcast control
system, provides credentials to the Authorization Server, which verifies them. These credentials consist of information
pertaining to the client itself, given by the Authorization Server upon successful registration, and to the user. The
mechanism used to verify credentials is out of scope for this document, but may involve widely used authentication
technologies such as a corporate Single Sign On, Kerberos or Microsoft Active Directory for example.

In its request, the client will also indicate what privileges it wants included in a token. If the Authorization Server
concurs that a given client may be permitted the privileges requested, it will grant a Bearer Token containing an
Authorization Token whose "claims" include the requested privileges.

The client uses the Authorization Token it has been issued with when it makes requests to protected resources on the
Resource Server. The Resource Server then validates the token, using the public key of the Authorization Server.
If the Resource Server finds that the token is valid for the protected resource to be accessed, it will allow the API
request to proceed.

Tokens are signed using a long-lived private key held by the Authorization Server. The Authorization Server makes
available its public key to Resource Servers, to allow them to validate tokens using that key.

Access tokens are short-lived for security purposes. To prevent multiple authorization requests to the user, OAuth 2.0
supports the concept of Refresh tokens. Refresh Tokens issued by the Authorization Server are much shorter-lived than
the Authorization Server secret key, but longer-lived than the Access Token. This means that the client may readily
employ the access token without needing to ask the end-user for their credentials, but allows system administrators
the opportunity to revoke access to the protected resources by the client by refusing to issue a new access token when
asked for a renewal.

## OAuth Grants

### Client Types (Informative)

[RFC 6749][RFC-6749] defines three different classes of OAuth 2.0 Client:
*   **Web application** - client credentials stored in a server.
*   **User-agent-based application** - client credentials stored in the user-agent (e.g browser).
*   **Native application** - client credentials stored in a native application (e.g broadcast control system).

It is important to understand what kind of client is being implemented, as this impacts on the OAuth 2.0 grant that it
may use.

In the [JT-NM Reference Architecture](http://jt-nm.org/RA-1.0/), clients are the consumers or modifiers of NMOS APIs,
typically Broadcast Control Systems when using Connection Management (IS-05), or NMOS Nodes, when using Discovery &
Registration (IS-04).

A broadcast control system that is built as a native app is a "Native Application" type, and a control system
implemented in a browser is a "User-agent-based application", and they should be treated accordingly when implementing
OAuth. [RFC 6749][RFC-6749] defines both these client types to be _Public Clients_.

Out of these three client types an NMOS Node most closely resembles a web application, because client credentials are
not stored in the user-agent or a native application. Instead they are stored on a server away from the resource owner.
The web application client type is the only OAuth 2.0 client type where this is permitted to be the case.
[RFC 6749][RFC-6749] considers such clients to be _Confidential Clients_.

### Grant Types (Informative)

OAuth 2.0 defines several different grant types. The preferred grant types are listed below.

*   Authorization Code Grant
*   Device Authorization Grant
*   Refresh Token Grant

The authorization code grant is optimised for confidential clients, and is recommended where possible for all NMOS
interactions. For use with public clients, such as control system type clients, the use of Proof Key for Code Exchange
(PKCE), outlined in [RFC 7636][RFC-7636], should be used. The authorization code grant is a redirection-based grant
flow. Upon successful submission of client credentials, user authorization is requested by the Authorization Server
using a HTML web page, native application page, etc, for the given set of requested scopes. Upon user consent, the user
is redirected to the client's registered redirect URI, with an authorization code in the query parameters. This code is
subsequently used by the client to gain a Bearer Token.

For browserless and input-restricted devices, the Device Authorization Grant described in [RFC 8628][RFC-8628] should be
used.

The refresh token grant is used when the client has been given a refresh token as part of a successful bearer token
request. This allows a client to request further access tokens without passing in user credentials or getting user
authorization. The refresh token should be bound to the client to which it was given, and bound to the same scopes that
were approved during the authorization request.

### Deprecated Grants (Informative)

The implicit grant, password credentials grant, and client credentials grant have now been deprecated in use by the
IETF's [Best Common Practices][oauth-bcp-13], being replaced with the authorization code grant flow using PKCE.

The implicit grant was originally designed for use with public clients and Single Page Web Applications who could not
feasibly keep their client credentials safe. This redirection grant issued the access token in the redirection URI and
was susceptable to access token leakage and access token replay attacks described in the IETF's
[Best Common Practices][oauth-bcp-13].

The resource owner password credentials grant was designed for situations where the resource owner had a strong trust
relationship with the client - this was typically reserved for first-party software applications. This grant has been
deprecated, due to the anti-pattern of submitting user credentials to the client, and is liable to phishing attacks.

The client credentials grant was designed for confidential clients, but requires the resource owner arrange for the
Authorization Server to allow access to protected resources out of band of the authorization process. This grant is
usually used in machine-to-machine operations in which there is no concept of a user.
