# Definitions

_See also the [NMOS Glossary](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos/wiki/Glossary) for concepts regarding the [JT-NM reference architecture](http://jt-nm.org/), and definitions within RFCs._

The below definitions are based on the [OAuth 2.0 spec][RFC-6749].

## API

An HTTP/WebSocket Application Programming Interface as defined in an AMWA NMOS Specification (e.g. IS-04, IS-05, IS-06, etc.)

## Protected Resource

Any part of the API that is access-restricted. This may apply to read (e.g GET) or write (e.g POST) operations.

## Resource Server

The entity that is providing APIs containing protected resources, for example:

- a Registry implementing IS-04 Registration and Query APIs
- a Node implementing IS-04 Node API and IS-05 Connection API.

### Resource Owner / End-User

An entity capable of granting a client access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.

## Authorization Server

The server issuing authorization codes and access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

## Client

The entity, usually a Web Application, Native application, or SPA (Single Page Application) that is attempting to act on the userâ€™s behalf or access a Protected Resource. A client must register with the Authorization Server before being able to request tokens. Clients are usually deemed to be Confidential or Public based on their ability to authenticate securely with the Authorization Server.

Within NMOS this may be:

- a Node registering with a Registry using the IS-04 Registration API
- a monitoring application querying Nodes using the IS-04 Query API
- a connection control application using the IS-05 Connection API

## Access Token

A short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) that may be used by a client to access Protected Resources on the Resource Server.

## Bearer Token

Bearer tokens contain . They are passed from the Authorization Server to the client after successful authentication of client credentials, and contain an access token. Bearer tokens can be used to retrieve further access tokens from the Authorization Server once the original access token expires.
